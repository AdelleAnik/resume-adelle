    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Adelle Gomes, a passionate Software Engineer with a love for blending creativity and logic into sleek, user-focused digital experiences. My journey into development started with a curiosity for how things work and evolved into a full-blown obsession with writing clean, scalable code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring experience across front-end and back-end technologies — from React and Redux to Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy mentoring, and am constantly seeking to improve through new challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you'll find me sketching UI ideas, geeking out over design systems, or experimenting with new web animations. ✨
