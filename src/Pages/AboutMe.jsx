        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Adelle Gomes, a passionate Software Engineer with a love for blending creativity and logic into sleek, user-focused digital experiences. My journey into development started with a curiosity for how things work and evolved into a full-blown obsession with writing clean, scalable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring experience across front-end and back-end technologies ‚Äî from React and Redux to Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Docker. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy mentoring, and am constantly seeking to improve through new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me sketching UI ideas, geeking out over design systems, or experimenting with new web animations. ‚ú®
        </p>
        <p>
          I also share my space with two pixel-perfect sidekicks ‚Äî a gray cat and a black-and-white bunny. They don‚Äôt code, but if you know the secret sequence, you might just see them hop by. üêæ
